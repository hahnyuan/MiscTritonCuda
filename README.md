# MiscTritonCuda

MiscTritonCuda is a feature-rich library designed to provide miscellaneous operators and helper functions related to Triton and CUDA acceleration. This library is not intended to be a highly formal project. It is primarily used for my personal interests and various scientific research explorations and engineering projects. I strive to ensure performance and correctness to the best of my abilities.

## Features

- **Triton operators**: MiscTritonCuda offers a collection of operators that can be used with Triton.

- **CUDA acceleration**: The library leverages CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model, to accelerate certain computations. This allows for faster execution of operations, enhancing the overall performance.

- **Python Integration**: MiscTritonCuda provides seamless integration with the python. We can use these operators and functions in python code to perform various operations related to Triton and CUDA acceleration. It can also used in pytorch.

## Usage

### Install

```
pip install torch triton
```


### Usage

```python
import MiscTritonCuda as mtc
